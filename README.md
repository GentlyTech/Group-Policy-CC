This program can help you circumvent windows group policies set by your administrator/organization.

This program does not bypass UAC or elevate you if you don't have admin rights, but merely makes it easier to strip policies set by your administrator/organization. Perhaps in the future the program may include exploits.

This program was created because some administrators enforce policies but give the students admin.
